# EHZ-capacity

This is an implementation for calculating the EHZ capacity of  a polytope in Matlab using the formula appearing in https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00039-019-00486-4.
A polytope K in R^{2n} with m vertices is represented as a matrix with m rows and 2n cols, such that each row is a vertex. The coordinate system is q_1,...q_n,p_1,...,p_n.

Currently, this implementation is not very efficient and it is very slow when the polytope has a large number of faces.
However, one can significantly improve the running time by eliminating many permutations based on the fact that the minimal permutation should correspond to a closed characteristic on the boundary of K (see Remark 3.11 in the aforementioned paper).
I will upload an updated version soon.

The software was developed on Matlab R2021b.
